# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project involves forecasting sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. The finance team is relying on machine learning to predict sales based on factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. The goal is to provide a reliable, end-to-end solution that can be used by store managers and finance analysts.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

```

```

## Objectives
The project is divided into four main tasks:

1. **Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior**  
   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate factors affecting customer behavior. Key focus areas include:
   - Promotions and their effect on sales
   - Sales trends around holidays and seasonal events
   - Assortment type and its effect on sales
   - Competition distance and its impact on store performance

2. **Prediction of Store Sales**  
   Build a machine learning model to predict store sales based on features such as promotions, holidays, assortment type, and competition.

3. **Machine Learning Approach**  
   Use machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble models to improve prediction accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison are included.

4. **Deep Learning Approach**  
   Investigate the use of deep learning models such as LSTMs to capture sequential patterns and improve sales forecasting.

5. **Serving Predictions on a Web Interface**  
   Deploy the trained model and serve predictions through a web interface for store managers and analysts.

## Setup and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - logging
  - numpy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shewanek/sales-prediction_week-4.git
   cd sales-prediction_week-4
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
- [Rossmann Store Sales | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data)

Place the downloaded data files into the `data/` folder:
```
data/
├── train.csv
├── test.csv
└── store.csv
```

### Running the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open the `eda_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda_notebook.ipynb
   ```
   - The notebook will load the data, clean it, and generate various plots for analysis.

2. **Logging**:
   - All steps and processes are logged in `rossmann_analysis.log` for traceability.

### Logging
All steps in the process, including data loading, cleaning, and EDA, are logged using Python's `logging` library. This ensures traceability and reproducibility of the steps taken during the analysis.

## Next Steps
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as sales trends, promotions, and competition history to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling**: Build machine learning models for sales forecasting and compare their performance.
- **Deployment**: Integrate the final model into a web application to serve predictions.

## Conclusion
This project aims to forecast Rossmann store sales using machine learning and deep learning models, with an emphasis on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model performance.
